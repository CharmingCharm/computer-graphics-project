Difficulties in doing the project:
	The group cooperation in using OPENGL is relatively difficult. One's coding is easily to have affection on the others' codes.
	We try to use GitHub for group cooperation, but did not figure out a fesiable way for solving crash problems.
	Finally, we choose to do version management manually, this cost a bit lot in this project.

	There is a large number of objects rendered in the scene, the adjustment of their positions costs a lot.

	For design of particle, fractal and so on, the resource accessiable on the Internet is limited, casuing some problems.
